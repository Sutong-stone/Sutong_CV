abstract: Increasingly serious ecological problems have generated a large number of focus on environmental-friendly green bonds. This paper makes an initial discussion based on China. We analyze the roles of potential factors that might affect issuers to choose between green or conventional bonds, as well as identify the confrontational combinations of the statistically significant determinants. A sample of green and matching conventional corporate bond issuance records since 2016 is studied through the multiple regressions and fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis. The results demonstrate different motives and premises drive firms to choose green or conventional bonds. This choice can be eventually attributed to the financing demand and the preference of issuers. The factors related to bonds’ specific characteristics, issuers’ financial features, and external ambience conditions might play significant roles in this decision process. Additionally, we summarized three causal paths affecting the green bond issuance choice. Overall, this paper provides a knowledge basis for targeted encouraging green bond issuance, some corresponding implications are also concluded.
