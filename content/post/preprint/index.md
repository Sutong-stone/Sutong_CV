abstract: 'Motivated by the lack of studies related to the uncertainties driving the green bond markets, we aim to fill this gap by discussing the effects of three uncertainty indicators on different market states. In specific, we applied the cross-quantilogram method to detect quantile dependences and utilize the quantile causality test for robustness as well as to capture predictive causalities. The USA and China have developed distinct green bond policy ambiance and markets to address environmental and carbon issues. To understand the uncertainty transmission to the green bond market, this paper mainly focused on the two pioneer markets, as representatives. The results show that uncertainties are important drivers for the return and volatilities of green bonds but they would play different roles in the two nations. The most influential uncertainty determinant of USA green bonds is financial uncertainty while China is economic policy uncertainty. Additionally, the impact on green bond returns would vary at different market states, green bond volatilities may respond abnormally to extreme increasing changes in the uncertainties. These findings imply the financial characteristics and the inside heterogeneities between different green bond markets. The corresponding great investment implications and policy significances are discussed in detail in the concluding section.'
