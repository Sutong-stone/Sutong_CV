abstract: Existing studies have investigated the Chinese Shanghai crude oil futures (INE) from price efficiency, cross-futures transmission, etc., but neglected the potential links with China. This paper is committed to filling this gap by conducting an initial discussion from the perspective of macro-financial factors. Applying the dynamic model averaging (DMA) approach, we examine the time-varying importance of the six potential factors that drive the INE prices. The results based on the overall conditions of all determinants and based on individual predictors both support the crucial roles of some Chinese macro-financial factors. The pricing effects of these factors almost display upward features within 6 months since the INE establishment. Thereafter, it maintains an overall stable trend, though some abnormal turmoil is found after the COVID-19 outbreak. According to the multi-scale analysis, the importance of China's macro-financial factors mainly reveals the INE market at the low-frequency components. To confirm the robustness of the estimation and the uniqueness of such effects on the INE, we utilize an alternative forecast accuracy criterion to confirm stability, accommodate the DMA estimation on the WTI and Brent oil futures prices as comparisons, and discuss the frequency domain through another decomposition procedure. These all mirror our findings.

summary: This paper finds an increasing role of China's macro-financial factors in pricing Shanghai crude oil futures. The changing importance of China's macro-financial factors is roughly divided into three stages. The year 2019 and the COVID-19 global spread could be the border of each stage. The main influence channel is contagion inside the financial market system. The importance of Chinese macro-finance factors is mainly in the short term.
